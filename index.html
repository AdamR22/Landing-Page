                A tree has roots in the soil yet reaches to the sky. It tells us that in order to aspire we need to be
                grounded and that no matter how high we go it is from our roots that we draw sustenance. It is a
                reminder to all of us who have had success that we cannot forget where we came from. It signifies that
                no matter how powerful we become in government or how many awards we receive, our power and strength and
                our ability to reach our goals depend on the people, those whose work remain unseen, who are the soil
                out of which we grow, the shoulders on which we stand
